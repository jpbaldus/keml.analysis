# KEML Analysis

This project analyses KEML files statistically. For each KEML file it produces:
1) [General Statistics](#general-statistics)
2) [Argumentation Statistics](#argumentation-statistics)
3) [Trust Scores](#trust-scores)

## Running

This project is a basic java application you can run in all normal ways (command line, IDE...).
It has one optional input: the base folder. If none is given, it creates statistics on the complete example from keml.sample - assuming that project is located on the same level as keml.io.
All these files are stored in the folder **analysis**.

## General Statistics


## Argumentation Statistics
